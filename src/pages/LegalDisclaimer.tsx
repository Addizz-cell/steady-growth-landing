            <p className="text-white/80 mb-3">
              The information provided on the Steady Growth Insight website and related services is for general informational purposes only. All investments involve risk, including the possible loss of all the money invested. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/80 mb-3">
              Trading foreign exchange (forex), binary options, and investments in real estate markets carries substantial risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest in forex, binary options, or real estate, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/80">
              The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with these investments and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.

            <p className="text-white/80 mb-3">
              Certain content on the Steady Growth Insight website may contain forward-looking statements that are based on expectations, estimates, projections, and assumptions. Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "plans," "believes," "scheduled," "estimates," variations of these words, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

              These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our business operations, financial condition, investment returns, and strategies. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual future results and trends may differ materially from what is forecast in forward-looking statements.

              Each individual's success depends on his or her background, dedication, desire, and motivation. As with any investment, there is potential that you could sustain losses of some or all of your investment.
