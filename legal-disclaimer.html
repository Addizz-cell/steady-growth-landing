              <p class="text-white-80 mb-3">
                Trading foreign exchange (forex) and binary options on margin carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest in forex or binary options, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite.
              </p>
              <p class="text-white-80 mb-3">
                The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with forex and binary options trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.
